    "| Cmdlet | Alias | Bash Equivalent | Description |\n",
    "| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n",
    "| `Get-ChildItem` | `gci` | `ls` | List the directories and files in the current location. | \n",
    "| `Set-Location` | `sl` | `cd` | Change to the directory at the given path. Typing `..` rather than a path will move up one directory. |\n",
    "| `Push-Location` | `pushd` | `pushd` | Changes to the directory. |\n",
    "| `Pop-Location` | `popd` | `popd` | Changes back to the previous directory after using `pushd` |\n",
    "| `New-Item` | `ni` | (`touch`) | Creates a new item. Used with no parameter, the item is by default a file. Using `mkdir` is a shortcut for including the parameter `-ItemType dir`. |\n",
    "| `mkdir` | none | `mkdir` | Creates a new directory. (See `New-Item`.) |\n",
    "| `Explorer` | `start .` | `open .`) | Open something using File Explorer (the GUI) |\n",
    "| `Remove-Item` | `rm` | `rm` | Deletes something. Permanently! |\n",
    "| `Move-Item` | `mv` | `mv` | Moves something. Takes two arguments - first a filename (i.e. its present path), then a path for its new location (including the name it should have there). By not changing the path, it can be used to rename files. |\n",
    "| `Copy-Item` | `cp` | `cp` | Copies a file to a new location. Takes same arguments as move, but keeps the original file in its location. |\n",
    "| `Write-Output` | `write` | `echo` | Outputs whatever you type. Use redirection to output to a file. Redirection with `>>` will add to the file, rather than overwriting contents. |\n",
    "| `Get-Content` | `gc` | `cat` | Gets the contents of a file and prints it to the screen. Adding the parameter `-TotalCount` followed by a number x prints only the first x lines. Adding the parameter `-Tail` followed by a number x prints only the final x lines. |\n",
    "| `Select-String` | `sls` | (`grep`) | Searches for specific content. |\n",
    "| `Measure-Object` | `measure` | (`wc`) | Gets statistical information about an object. Use `Get-Content` and pipe the output to `Measure-Object` with the parameters `-line`, `-word`, and `-character` to get word count information. |\n",
    "| `>` | none | `>` |Redirection. Puts the output of the command to the left of `>` into a file to the right of `>`. |\n",
    "| `\\|` | none | `\\|` |Piping. Takes the output of the command to the left and uses it as the input for the command to the right. |\n",
    "| `Get-Help` | none | `man` | Gets the help file for a cmdlet. Adding the parameter `-online` opens the help page on TechNet. |\n",
    "| `exit` | none | `exit` | Exits PowerShell |\n",
