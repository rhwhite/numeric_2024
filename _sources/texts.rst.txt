Optional textbooks
==================


The labs in this course are meant to be self-contained.  If you'd like additional information/greater depth here are
some texts that we have found useful:

- `Computational Physics with Python <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/computational-physics/>`_
  `Amazon.ca link <http://www.amazon.ca/Computational-Physics-Mark-Newman/dp/1480145513>`_

  * Comprehensive treatment of our course topics using physics-examples (but obviously the techniques and equations apply
    to all disciplines).  Good python intro material in Chapters 2 and 3 can be downloaded at the author's website.


- `Introduction to applied mathematics, Gilbert Strang <http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1062079>`_
  Compact chapters on ordinary differential equations and linear algebra
